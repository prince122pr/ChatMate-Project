# ðŸ“˜ AI Memory & Retrieval Notes

## 1. Vectors
- **Definition**:  
  A vector is an ordered list of numbers that represents data in a mathematical space.  
  In AI, vectors are used to represent text, images, or audio in a way that machines can understand.

- **Example**:  
  The word `"king"` might be represented as:  
  `[0.21, -0.67, 0.13, 0.88, ...]`  
  (a list of floating-point numbers)

- **Why Vectors in AI?**  
  - Machines cannot understand raw words or images.  
  - By converting them into **vectors (numbers)**, we can compare similarities, find relations, and perform computations.  
  - Example: `"king" - "man" + "woman" â‰ˆ "queen"`

## 2. Embeddings
- **Definition**:  
  Embeddings are **vector representations of data** (text, image, audio) created by a model.  
  They capture **semantic meaning**.

- **Properties**:  
  - Similar items â†’ vectors close to each other.  
  - Different items â†’ vectors far apart.

- **Example**:  
  - `"cat"` â†’ `[0.11, 0.89, -0.55, ...]`  
  - `"dog"` â†’ `[0.10, 0.91, -0.50, ...]`  
  - Cosine similarity between them â‰ˆ **0.95** (very similar)

## 3. Vector Databases
- **Problem**:  
  Normal databases (SQL/NoSQL) are not optimized for finding "similar" items.  
  E.g., *find me documents most similar to this query*.

- **Solution**:  
  Vector databases store embeddings and perform **similarity search** efficiently.
  A vector database **indexes** and **stores vector embeddings** for **fast retrieval** and **similarity search**, with capabilities like **CRUD operations**, metadata filtering, horizontal scaling, and serverless.

- **Examples**:  
  - **Pinecone**  
  - **Weaviate**  
  - **Milvus**  
  - **Redis (with vector search support)**

## 4. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- **Definition**:  
  A technique where an LLM retrieves relevant data from a knowledge base (vector DB) before generating an answer.

- **Steps**:  
  1. **User Query** â†’ Convert into embedding.  
  2. **Retrieve** â†’ Find most relevant docs from vector DB (e.g., Redis, Pinecone).  
  3. **Augment** â†’ Pass retrieved docs + query to LLM.  
  4. **Generate** â†’ LLM produces an answer with context.  

- **Example**:  
  - Query: *"What is React?"*  
  - Vector DB retrieves: `"React is a JavaScript library for UI..."`  
  - LLM final answer:  
    *"React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Meta..."*

## 5. Long-Term Memory in AI
- **Problem**:  
  LLMs have a limited context window (e.g., 4kâ€“128k tokens). They forget old info.

- **Solution**:  
  Use **vectors + RAG + vector DB** to simulate memory.  

- **How it works**:  
  - Each user interaction (text, notes, chat history) â†’ converted into embeddings.  
  - Stored in **vector DB (e.g., Redis, Pinecone)**.  
  - On new queries, system **retrieves past relevant info**.  
  - Feels like AI has "long-term memory".

- **Example**:  
  - User Day 1: *"My name is Prince."* â†’ stored as vector.  
  - User Day 30: *"Whatâ€™s my name?"* â†’ query embedding retrieves vector â†’ LLM: *"Your name is Prince."*

## Who Converts Data into Vectors?

- In AI, **embedding models** convert raw data (text, images, audio) into vectors.  
- For example, **Google's `gemini-embedding-001`** is a model that transforms text into high-dimensional vectors.  
- These vectors capture **meaning, context, and relationships** between words/sentences.  
- Similar texts â†’ have **closer vectors** (cosine similarity near 1).  
- They are then stored in a **vector database** for tasks like search, retrieval, and long-term memory.
