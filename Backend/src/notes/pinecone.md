# Pinecone Notes

## What is Pinecone?
- A **vector database** that stores and retrieves data using vectors (arrays of numbers).
- Unlike normal databases (MongoDB, SQL) that search exact matches, Pinecone finds results by **similarity in meaning**.

---

## Why Vectors?
- AI models convert text/images into **embeddings** (vectors).
- Similar meanings → vectors are close.
  - Example:  
    - "dog" → [0.12, -0.33, 0.98]  
    - "puppy" → [0.13, -0.31, 0.95]  
  - Pinecone can detect similarity even if words differ.

## What Pinecone Does
1. **Stores embeddings** (from Gemini, OpenAI, etc.).
2. **Searches embeddings** to find top-k closest matches.
3. **Returns results** to use as context for an LLM.

---

## Why Use Pinecone?
- **Semantic Search** → Finds data by meaning, not keywords.
- **Scalable** → Handles millions of vectors.
- **Fast** → Optimized for nearest neighbor search.
- **LLM Friendly** → Commonly used for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).

## ChatMate Flow with Pinecone
1. User query → "Tell me about React".
2. Convert to embedding (Gemini embeddings).
3. Store or query in Pinecone.
4. Retrieve similar stored texts.
5. Provide context to LLM → generate final answer.

## Key Terms
- **Embedding**: Numeric vector representing meaning of text.
- **Upsert**: Insert or update a vector in Pinecone.
- **Query**: Search for similar vectors in Pinecone.
- **Metadata**: Extra info stored with vectors (e.g., user, timestamp).

---

## Analogy
Think of Pinecone as a **search engine for your own data**:
- MongoDB → exact diary of events.
- Pinecone → librarian that understands meaning.
